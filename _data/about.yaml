  Modeling Microtubule Catastrophe: Gamma Distribution vs. Two-Step Poisson Process
authors: >
  Suhash Aravindan, Alveera Khan, Sarah Hou
Abstract: >
  We modeled microtubule catastrophe dynamics based on a gamma distribution versus multiple Poisson processes to determine which model fits better. To do so, we used the data generated by Gardner and Zanic et al. in their paper “Depolymerizing Kinesins Kip3 and MCAK Shape Cellular Microtubule Architecture by Differential Control of Catastrophe” from monitoring fluorescently labeled and unlabeled microtubulin.
