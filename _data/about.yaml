Abstract: >
  We modeled Caulobacter crescentus growth with a linear model and an
  exponential model to determine which model fits the data
  better. To do so, we used data from Norbert Schererâ€™s lab
  from UChicago where they imaged single dividing Caulobacter cells.
Summary:  >
  Caulobacter crescentus division works as follows:
      The mother cell is adherent to the a surface through its stalk.
      Upon division, one of the daughter cells does not have a stalk
      and is mobile. The system is part of a microfluidic device that
      gives a constant flow. So, every time a mother cell divides, the
      un-stalked daughter cell gets washed away. In such a way, the
      dividing cells are never in a crowded environment and the buffer
      is always fresh. This also allows for easier segmentation.
      
  By examining the images, we were able to choose a good candidate cell for
  segmentation. We then graphed the growth events to illustrate the growth rate
  of bacteria when preparing for division. We then labeled growth events, and
  performed some very basic statistical analysis.
  Finally we modeled exponential vs linear growth for all growth events to see
  which story fit better. We found that exponential growth matched the cell Growth
  during division best.
